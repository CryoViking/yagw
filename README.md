# yagw - Yet Another Go Watcher

I simply wanted to have a go at making my own simple go watcher, not for running the go programs yet.
Simply to automate the building or testing the programs.

## <a name="contributing"></a>Contributing

If this project blows up then I'll figure out a proper process for contributing.  
For now tho just follow the following steps (normal for most projects afaik)

1. Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix: `git checkout -b feature-branch-name`.
3. Make your changes and ensure they are well-tested.
4. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Description of your changes"`.
5. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature-branch-name`.
6. Submit a pull request to the `master` branch of the original repository.
7. Ensure your pull request includes a clear description of the changes made and any relevant information for reviewers.
8. After submitting your pull request, a project maintainer (me for now) will review your changes and provide feedback.
9. Once your changes are approved, they will be merged into the `master` branch and become part of the project.

## <a name="roadmap"></a>Roadmap (IDK)
Yeah look... I don't know if I'll keep working on this. I primarily built this for my own use so 
as I get annoyed with things I'll make changes and push.
